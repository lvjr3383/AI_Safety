# Reproducibility Audit — open-source-alignment-faking

**Audited:** 2026-02-27
**Fixed:** 2026-02-27
**Goal:** Document all friction points blocking a new researcher from running this repo in under 10 minutes. See **Fixes Applied** section at the bottom for resolution of all 11 issues.

**PRs submitted:**
- [safety-tooling #155](https://github.com/safety-research/safety-tooling/pull/155) — fix startup crash when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset (FP-3)
- [open-source-alignment-faking #2](https://github.com/safety-research/open-source-alignment-faking/pull/2) — one-click setup script, `.env.example`, Dockerfile (FP-1, 2, 4–10)
- [open-source-alignment-faking #4](https://github.com/safety-research/open-source-alignment-faking/pull/4) — propagate `model_ids` → `model_id` rename (FP-11)

---

## Summary

Out of the box, a fresh researcher cannot run `./experiments/examples/1_run_pipeline.sh` at all. The script crashes before making a single API call due to missing environment setup. And even after environment setup is fixed, a separate breaking API change in a dependency makes every inference call crash at runtime. Total friction points found: **11** (3 BLOCKERs, 4 MODERATE, 4 MINOR).

## Friction Points

### FP-1 · BLOCKER · Submodule uses SSH, not HTTPS

**Where:** `.gitmodules` line 3
**What happened:**
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/safety-research/open-source-alignment-faking
```
The main repo clones fine over HTTPS, but the `safety-tooling` submodule is configured with an SSH URL:
```
url = git@github.com:safety-research/safety-tooling.git
```
This causes an immediate authentication failure for anyone without an SSH key registered with GitHub:
```
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```
**Impact:** The repo cannot be cloned out-of-the-box using the HTTPS URL given in the README. Researchers must either (a) know to override the submodule URL manually, or (b) have SSH keys set up.
**Workaround used:**
```bash
git -c submodule.safety-tooling.url=https://github.com/safety-research/safety-tooling.git \
    submodule update --init --recursive
```

---

### FP-2 · BLOCKER · `uv` not pre-installed, `source $HOME/.local/bin/env` fails

**Where:** `safety-tooling/README.md` step 1
**What happened:** `uv` is not a standard system tool. After running the install script:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env   # <-- THIS FAILS
```
The file `$HOME/.local/bin/env` does not exist after installation on macOS. The actual binary is at `$HOME/.local/bin/uv`. The `source` command produces:
```
(eval):source:1: no such file or directory: /Users/.../env
```
**Impact:** Anyone who copies the README command literally will have `uv` installed but not on their `PATH`, and will get a confusing error before they can proceed.
**Workaround used:**
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

---

### FP-3 · BLOCKER · `OPENAI_API_KEY` required even for Anthropic-only runs

**Where:** `safety-tooling/safetytooling/apis/inference/api.py` lines 150–162
**What happened:** Running the pipeline with the default model `claude-3-opus-20240229` (Anthropic) crashes immediately:
```
openai.OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key
to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
```
**Root cause:** `InferenceAPI.__init__()` unconditionally instantiates `OpenAIChatModel` and `OpenAICompletionModel` at construction time — before any model routing occurs. The `openai.AsyncClient()` call inside those classes requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set in the environment, even if the user will only ever call an Anthropic or Together model.
**Impact:** A researcher who only has an Anthropic API key cannot run the example pipeline at all without also setting a dummy or real OpenAI key.
**No workaround exists** without modifying `api.py` or setting `OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy`.

---

### FP-4 · MODERATE · No `.env.example` in the main repo root

**Where:** Main repo root
**What happened:** The main `README.md` says:
> "Ensure to make a `.env` file with your API keys."

But there is no `.env.example` file in the main repo to copy. The only `.env.example` is in `safety-tooling/`. The README does not say:
- Which directory the `.env` file should be placed in
- What keys are required vs. optional
- Where to find the template

**Impact:** New researchers must discover `safety-tooling/.env.example` themselves and figure out where to place their `.env`.

---

### FP-5 · MODERATE · Confusing default `openai_tag` vs. standard `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Where:** `safety-tooling/safetytooling/utils/experiment_utils.py` line ~40
**What happened:** `ExperimentConfigBase` defaults to:
```python
openai_tag: str = "OPENAI_API_KEY1"
```
This means `setup_environment()` looks for `OPENAI_API_KEY1` in the `.env`, not the standard `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The `.env.example` lists `OPENAI_API_KEY1=` as an "alternative key" field. A researcher who sets the standard `OPENAI_API_KEY=` in their `.env` may still see warnings that OpenAI is not available, while the API client still requires it at init time (see FP-3).
**Impact:** Confusing key naming — standard env var name does not match the default `openai_tag`.

---

### FP-6 · MODERATE · Setup instructions split across two READMEs with no clear path

**Where:** Main `README.md` and `safety-tooling/README.md`
**What happened:** The main README says:
> "Follow the instructions in safety-tooling/README.md to set up the environment."

But the `safety-tooling/README.md` setup instructions are written for standalone installation of that library (including `git clone safety-tooling`, `cd safety-tooling`, `uv venv`, etc.) — steps that are wrong or redundant when `safety-tooling` is used as a submodule. There is no clear delineation of which steps apply when using it as a submodule vs. standalone.
**Impact:** A new researcher following `safety-tooling/README.md` literally will try to clone a separate repo they already have, create a venv inside the submodule, and activate it — leading to a broken environment.

---

### FP-7 · MODERATE · `venv` location and activation not specified

**Where:** Main `README.md`
**What happened:** The main README does not say where to create the virtual environment or how to activate it before running `uv pip install`. The `safety-tooling/README.md` says to run `uv venv` inside `safety-tooling/`, which creates `.venv` there — but that venv would not be active when running `python -m src.run` from the repo root.
**Impact:** A researcher may install packages into the wrong venv (or into the system/global Python), then find that `python -m src.run` cannot find them.
**Correct behavior** (confirmed working): create and activate venv in the **main repo root**, then `uv pip install -e safety-tooling && uv pip install -r requirements.txt`.

---

### FP-8 · MINOR · Missing system dependency: `ffmpeg`

**Where:** Runtime warning when script starts
**What happened:** When the pipeline script executes, the following warning appears immediately:
```
RuntimeWarning: Couldn't find ffmpeg or avconv - defaulting to ffmpeg, but may not work
```
This comes from `pydub`, which is a dependency of `safetytooling`. `ffmpeg` is not a Python package — it's a system binary that must be installed separately (e.g., `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS, `apt install ffmpeg` on Ubuntu).
**Impact:** `ffmpeg` is not mentioned anywhere in the README or `requirements.txt`. For audio-related features, this will silently fail.

---

### FP-9 · MINOR · `requirements.txt` comments reference external repos not needed for basic use

**Where:** `requirements.txt` lines 1–2
**What happened:**
```
# safety-tooling (submodule) https://github.com/safety-research/safety-tooling
# openweights (optional for running finetuning and inference on RunPod) https://github.com/longtermrisk/openweights
```
The comment about `openweights` suggests it may be needed, but it is not listed as a pip dependency and the README does not mention it. It is only used in a conditional branch of `run.py` (`use_open_weights=True`). This creates confusion about whether `openweights` needs to be installed manually.

---

### FP-10 · MINOR · `1_run_pipeline.sh` hardcodes 50 workers and high concurrency — no "dry run" mode

**Where:** `experiments/examples/1_run_pipeline.sh` lines 19–21
**What happened:**
```bash
workers=50
anthropic_num_threads=45
together_num_threads=10
```
The script runs 100 HarmBench examples with 45 Anthropic threads and no dry-run option. There is no `--dry_run` flag, no `--limit 1` example in the README, and no note about cost or rate limits. A researcher who successfully authenticates will immediately start a 100-example run burning API credits.
**Impact:** Potential surprise API costs; no way to do a smoke-test with 1 example from the documented entry point.

---

### FP-11 · BLOCKER · `model_ids` parameter renamed to `model_id` in safety-tooling — never propagated to main repo

**Where:** `src/pipeline/evals.py` lines 156 and 771, `src/run.py` line 129, `src/utils.py` line 126
**What happened:** The `safety-tooling` submodule had a silent breaking change. In PR #58 (commit `6c550c4`), the function that sends prompts to the AI model was updated and its first argument was renamed from `model_ids` (plural) to `model_id` (singular). The function also dropped support for passing a list of models — it now accepts only a single model name as a plain string.

This change was never reflected in the main repo. Every place in the main repo that calls this function still passes the old argument name `model_ids=...`. In Python, if you call a function with a keyword argument it doesn't recognise, it raises a `TypeError` immediately and stops. So even after fixing all 10 environment/setup issues above, the pipeline crashes the moment it tries to make its first AI API call:

```
TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'model_ids'
```

**Root cause in plain terms:** Think of it like a form that used to have a field called "Model IDs" (plural, accepting a comma-separated list). The form was redesigned so the field is now called "Model ID" (singular, one entry only). The people filling out the form never got the memo, and are still writing in the old field name — so the form rejects every submission.

**Why it's easy to miss:** The error only appears at inference time, not at import time or startup. The repo runs successfully up to the point of sending a prompt. Researchers who get past the setup hurdles will see a clean startup and then hit this crash, with no hint in the README that a dependency API changed.

**The four affected call sites:**

| File | Line | Old (broken) | New (correct) |
|------|------|--------------|---------------|
| `src/pipeline/evals.py` | 156 | `model_ids=self.model_id` | `model_id=self.model_id` |
| `src/pipeline/evals.py` | 771 | `model_ids=self.model_id` | `model_id=self.model_id` |
| `src/run.py` | 129 | `model_ids=cfg.model_name` | `model_id=cfg.model_name` |
| `src/utils.py` | 126 | `model_ids=model_id` | `model_id=model_id` |

**Impact:** The pipeline cannot complete any inference at all. Every attempt to call the AI model crashes. This renders the entire research pipeline non-functional regardless of setup.
**Fix:** Changed all four call sites to use `model_id=` (singular). Four one-word changes across three files. Confirmed by tracing the rename to safety-tooling commit `6c550c4` via `git show`.
**Filed:** [Issue #3](https://github.com/safety-research/open-source-alignment-faking/issues/3) — fixed in [PR #4](https://github.com/safety-research/open-source-alignment-faking/pull/4).

## Environment Snapshot at Time of Audit

| Item | Version/State |
|------|--------------|
| OS | macOS Darwin 25.3.0 (aarch64) |
| Python | 3.11.14 (installed via `uv`) |
| uv | 0.10.7 |
| Safety-tooling submodule commit | `21a7264aaeb0a7d7150787d02c355ec70bf49dd2` |
| OPENAI_API_KEY | Not set |
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Not set |
| ffmpeg | Not installed |

---

## What Happens When You Run `./experiments/examples/1_run_pipeline.sh`

With no `.env` file and no API keys set, the script fails immediately with:
```
openai.OpenAIError: The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key
to the client or by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
```
The log file is created in `./outputs/suffix-True-new-classifiers-True/logs/`, but no inference is attempted. The error occurs inside `InferenceAPI.__init__()` before any model routing or prompt loading.

---

## Priority Order for One-Click Setup Script / Docker Container

1. **FP-3** — Fix or document the OpenAI key requirement (even for Anthropic runs). Consider lazy initialization of provider clients.
2. **FP-1** — Switch submodule URL to HTTPS (or provide a setup script that uses HTTPS override).
3. **FP-4 + FP-5** — Add `.env.example` to the repo root with clear annotations on required vs. optional keys and correct default key names.
4. **FP-6 + FP-7** — Rewrite or consolidate setup instructions; clarify venv location and activation.
5. **FP-2** — Fix the `source $HOME/.local/bin/env` instruction; use `export PATH` instead.
6. **FP-8** — Add `ffmpeg` to system prerequisites in README.
7. **FP-10** — Add a minimal smoke-test command (e.g., `--limit 1`) to the README.
8. **FP-9** — Clarify `openweights` install status in README.

## Fixes Applied

All 11 friction points have been resolved. The repo now supports one-click setup via `bash setup.sh`.

### New files added

| File | Fixes |
|------|-------|
| `setup.sh` | FP-1, FP-2, FP-4, FP-5, FP-6, FP-7, FP-8, FP-10 |
| `.env.example` | FP-3 (documented), FP-4, FP-5, FP-9 |
| `Dockerfile` | FP-1, FP-2, FP-8 |
| `.dockerignore` | Docker image hygiene |

### Submodule patches (safety-tooling)

**FP-3** was fixed by patching three files in `safety-tooling/safetytooling/apis/inference/openai/`:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `base.py` | In `OpenAIModel.__init__`, the `else` branch now passes `api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "not-configured")` to `openai.AsyncClient()`, so the client initialises without crashing when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is absent. |
| `embedding.py` | `OpenAIEmbeddingModel.__init__` uses the same sentinel pattern. |
| `moderation.py` | `OpenAIModerationModel.__init__` uses the same sentinel pattern. |
| `s2s.py` | `OpenAIS2SModel.__init__` used `os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]` (hard dict access, raises `KeyError`). Changed to `os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "not-configured")`. |

**Root cause explanation:** `openai` v1+ raises `OpenAIError` at `AsyncClient()` construction time if no `api_key` is found — either via parameter or `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var. Because `InferenceAPI.__init__()` eagerly constructs all provider clients (including OpenAI), the crash occurred even when running purely Anthropic models. The sentinel value `"not-configured"` satisfies the constructor; actual OpenAI API calls will fail with HTTP 401 if a real key is not set, which is a clear and expected error.
